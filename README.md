# PaletteMaker
I sometimes struggle to come up with good colour palettes when drawing. Iâ€™ve noticed that colour combinations found in nature are often stunning, even when they have strong contrasts. So, I decided to create a tool that can sample any image I provide and generate a palette based on it. P.S. It works with any image, not just nature.
